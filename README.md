### ABOUT ME

I am a dedicated and passionate full-stack developer with over six years of experience building dynamic and scalable web and mobile applications. My expertise spans React, React Native, Next.js, TypeScript, Redux, and RESTful API integrations for both iOS and Android platforms. I have a strong background in designing and developing end-to-end solutions, integrating third-party services, and ensuring high-performance mobile and web experiences. I'm committed to pixel-perfect UI/UX implementation, performance optimization, and writing clean, well-documented code. I also teach mobile and web development via my YouTube channel [TechStack Media](https://youtube.com/@techstackmedia), sharing my insights with a broader developer community.
